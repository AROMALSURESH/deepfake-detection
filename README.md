# 🕵️ Deepfake Detection

This project focuses on detecting deepfake media using deep learning models. It leverages two trained models to identify whether a given video or image is real or AI-generated (fake).

## 📁 Project Overview

- Built using Python and popular deep learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch / TensorFlow).
- Uses pre-trained models for classification.
- Designed for researchers, students, and developers interested in AI-generated content detection.

## 🧠 Trained Models

The project uses two trained models, which are not included in this repository due to size limitations.

🔗 **Download Models from Google Drive**:  
[Click here to access the models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q0ADd_oDo_pDy2RHX0tBv_8--irXJLvd?usp=sharing)

After downloading, place the models inside the `models/` directory.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AROMALSURESH/deepfake-detection.git
